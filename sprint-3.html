        </ul>
        <p>1. <b>As a user, I can create an event:</b> 3 story points</p>
        <p><b>Details:</b> As an events website, a key feature for users is to be able to create events. It is the main purpose of our website to enable people to create and promote their events in order to connect with others. Therefore, the event has to have a title, a date, a location and an image. This page will also be linked to the Home and About page for users to easily navigate through our website.</p>
        <img src="img/Yoga_3.png" />
        <p>2. <b>As a user, I won't be allowed to create "bad" events: </b> 2 story points</p>
        <p><b>Details:</b> This story imposes logic on the creation of our events. To optimize the user experience, we will impose some constraints on the creation of events, so that only “valid” events can be created. This will filter out “bad” events as well as allow our users to market their events with appropriate pictures, description etc.</p>
        <p>For example, we will impose the following conditions on any events created on our website:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Should not allow event with no title</li>
            <li>Should not allow event with too-long title (>50 characters)</li>
            <li>Should not allow event with no image</li>
            <li>Should not allow event with bad image</li>
            <li>Should not allow event with no location</li>
            <li>Should not allow event with too-long location</li>
            <li>Should allow event creation with valid parameters, redirecting to the new event after creation</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="img/CreateEvent-3.png" />
        <p>3. As a the website owner (business user), I can perform analytics on traffic to my website: 1 story point</p>
        <p><b>Details:</b> This ticket is for the internal user of the website, (i.e. our team, the website owner). It is helpful for us to be able to analyze our web traffic. This includes how our users reached our site and their activities on our website. This will be very useful for us in determining how to get more users, and also how to optimize our website for the best user experience.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Burn Chart:</b></li>
        </ul>
        <img src="img/burndown-3.png" />
        <p>The burndown chart shows that we were able to get to a faster start compared to the first sprint. We burned 4 story points within the first 4 days. Therefore, we realized that we may have extra capacity for this week and decided to add the analytics ticket worth 1 story point into our sprint. Therefore, we were able to deliver 7 story points across 3 user stories this week.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Narrative:</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We had one team meeting on Thursday this week. This is because we were more familiar with the systems and more accustomed to each other’s working styles. During this meeting, we held a Sprint Demo and a Retrospective. During the Sprint Demo, we previewed our website and tested the features delivered (creation of the events, validation, and analytics).</p>
        <p>During the Retrospective, we reflected on the process during the sprint this week. As mentioned earlier, we discussed our excess capacity for this week. Specifically, we added one more story point to our sprint given our additional capacity. We also were able to calculate our average burn rate, and honed in on an average of 5.5 story points per week. Therefore, for our next sprint, we have assigned 5 story points to complete.</p>
        <p>We also discussed our roles within the team. We decided to designate a different product owner for the week in order to increase exposure to the role within the team, and to develop our team members. Our process this week was a good balance between efficiency and personal development, and we would like to keep this going forward.</p>
